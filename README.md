#### Shock to SRS
This APDL script converts a 1/2 sine pulse shock (specified) as an amplitude in Gs and duration in seconds, to the equivalent SRS signal suitable for use in ANSYS APDL or Mechanical. The SRS is output as a CSV file, srs.csv. It can be loaded into excel for easy copy and paste into Workbench.
